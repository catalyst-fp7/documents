Many tools have been built to try to solve various problems in online collective intelligence (CI).

This consortium believes that the lack of shared standards to allow such tools to exchange data with each other and share results on standard Internet platforms has prevented these tools to build upon one-another's strengths and greatly hurt the broader adoption of specialized CI tools in Internet conversations.

This document attempts to describe and standardize the most common interactions of software tools applicable to the CI field to foster adoption, reuse, experimentation and research.

It is built upon the belief that at this stage in the adoption curve of CI tools, a "lowest common denominator" approach provides the best chance that multiple tools outside the catalyst consortium will adopt the standard.
